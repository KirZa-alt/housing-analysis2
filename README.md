## 📌 Objectives

- Load and explore the housing dataset.
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Generate visualizations to support findings.
- Draw conclusions and insights from the data.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook (optional)

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KirZa-alt/housing.py.git
   cd housing.py
````

2. Install dependencies (if required):

   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
   ```

3. Run the analysis script:

   ```bash
   python kiran_HousingAnalysis.py
   ```

## 📊 Sample Analyses

* Distribution of house prices
* Correlation between variables (e.g., size vs. price)
* Detection of outliers
* Missing value treatment

## 📈 Visualizations

The project includes various plots such as:

* Histograms
* Boxplots
* Scatter plots
* Correlation heatmaps

## ✅ Conclusion

This project serves as a basic foundation for understanding data preprocessing and visualization in the context of real-world housing datasets. It's a good starting point for further exploration using machine learning.
