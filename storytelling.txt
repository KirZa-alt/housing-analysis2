STORY TELLING

The housing dataset provides valuable insights into the property market.
 The average house price is moderately high, but the wide range and 
 large standard deviation indicate that prices vary greatly across different
  areas. A few outliers in the data, especially extremely high prices,
   pull the mean up, which is clearly seen in the skewed distributions.
    House areas also show large variation, suggesting a mix of small 
    apartments and large homes in the dataset. Interestingly, the scatter
     plot of price versus area shows a positive trend — as the area increases,
     price tends to rise — but not always linearly, suggesting other factors 
     like location or furnished status may play a role. 
     The consistency in bedroom counts points to typical family-sized housing, but extreme cases exist. Overall, this dataset reflects a dynamic and diverse housing market, where price is influenced not only by size but likely by other hidden variables too. These insights can help buyers, sellers, and real estate analysts 
     better understand price drivers and housing patterns in the region.
